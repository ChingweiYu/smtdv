Undefined Length Burst Operation

For a SPLIT transfer the arbiter will adjust the priority scheme so that any other
master requesting the bus will get access, even if it is a lower priority. In order
for a SPLIT transfer to complete the arbiter must be informed when the slave has
the data available.

For RETRY the arbiter will continue to use the normal priority scheme and
therefore only masters having a higher priority will gain access to the bus.
