* Description:

This package contains the SystemVerilog, SystemC and e infrastructure 
necessary for mixed language UVM verification environments.

Note that if you are an IES, you already have this library files installed. We
recommend using the installed versions, as the installation and path concerns 
are already resolved there.

* Documentation:

   The documentation for all of the above is in IES documentation, and in 
   PDF format in docs/


* Usage:


   1) Launch the demo.sh to see an example of a mixed language environment.

   $ ./demo.sh
