  - xbus_e is a bus eVC slightly simplified from the version used in the IES 
    release. It is used in the sv_over_e sequence layering example to 
    demonstrate how SystemVerilog code can drive this eVC by sending sequence 
    items and invoking sequences in the eVC.

  - ubus_sv is a SystemVerilog bus UVC slightly modified from the version 
    delivered in the UVM-SV release. It is used in the e_over_sv sequence 
    layering example to demonstrate how e code can drive this UVC by sending 
    sequence items and invoking sequences in the UVC.
