                                 UVM_ML Demo

This simple environment demonstrates the basic features of ML-UVM. Two 
independent environments, one in SystemC and one in SystemVerilog are 
co-simulated, exchanging data using TLM1 and TLM2 transactions, both blocking 
and non-blocking, in both directions.

Each environment has a top component with an "env" component under it. The env 
components have producer and consumer components. The producers generate data 
and send it through the various ports and sockets, while the consumers react 
to the data using both the blocking and non-blocking interfaces.

to set-up the environment refer to the README file at the top of this package. 

to run the demo on IES:
	% demo.sh IES

to run with VCS and OSCI:
	% demo.sh VCS

to run with Questa and OSCI:
	% demo.sh QUESTA
